# NLP Stats Libary

This repository has defined functions based on the asked questions. 

## Installation of Python3
```
sudo apt update
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.8
```

## Steps to run the program
```
python3 utils.py
```

The program has all the functions printed for the testing file (random.txt) on the asked questions.

To get the output on sample/custom text, the random.txt has to be overriden with the sample/custom text and program has to be re-run again.

Either way, utils.py serves as the library for the function. Hence, below function statement (as an example ) import would also work in any other python file when this library is integrated in the project structure.

```
from utils import average_letters
```
